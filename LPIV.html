            <p>
              I'm an enthusiastic Web/Software Developer who has turned a
              curiosity into a reality. I enrolled at DigitalCrafts in January
              of 2020 to study Full Stack Web Development and take a budding
              passion to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a musician at heart who has been extremely fortunate to travel
              the world playing music for most of my adult life. I've had an
              incredible journey and made invaluable friends, but I felt the
              need to broaden my horizon to include something outside of music.
              I have fallen in love with programming and building things
              digitally. The parallels between music and Web Development are
              such that it was a seemless transition to jump right in. I'm very
              excited to begin a new chapter and continue learning.

                I'm a frequent traveller and sometimes you find yourself with an
                unexpected night off in an unfamiliar city. Or perhaps you're at
                home bored and curious as to what may be happening in your own
                city tonight.

                The goal of this project was to take a ZIP code or city,
                provided by the user, and generate a list of local events as
                well as cultural sites in the given location. Using various
                APIs, the site would provide local weather, music, sports,
                comedy and film events happening that day. Each event listed had
                a link to their respective page and each culural site had a link
                to the wikipedia page.

                Based on the board game Pandemic, this was my first full stack group project created
                alonside 3 other developers. The premise for the game was to make a smaller and 
                more localized version of the popular game using a database to record the game state 
                and populate the board. The game takes place over the course of 19 days and in that time 
                you are travelling across the state in search of research. Winning is accomplished with a 
                cooperative effort to uncover 4 research breakthroughs before the epidemic becomes untenable. 
                Built using Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JS and PostgreSQL.

                Built in Python, my first project, Wizard In The Woods, is a top
                down shooter game with a nod to 16-bit fantasy RPGs. It starts
                simple enough with our hero finding himself in an unfortunate
                situation, alone in the woods. The rest is up to you...
